The chart only shows price history of BTC-USDT starting from 2019 along with its Moving Average which is currently windowed to 200 day.
SMA = Simple Moving Average

Moving average is a way to make sense of data that changes over time. It's like looking at the average of a certain number of recent data to get a much clearer picture of the trend instead of getting distracted by small ups and downs. 
Moving average is basically a mean. For example: 
Day 1 Price = 100
Day 2 Price = 120
Day 3 Price = 130
Day 4 Price = 125
Day 5 Price = 120
Moving Average = 100 + 120 + 130 + 125 + 120/5
Window Size in this example = 5

//
df = yf.download('BTC-USD', start='2019-01-01')
    closing_price = df['Adj Close']
//

First I extracted the data of BTC-USD from yahoo finance website. And filtered out only the desired column I need. In this case "Adjusted Close".
Then I defined the window-size which is definately changable.

//
sma_values = np.zeros_like(closing_price)
//

"sma_values" is an array. This moving average stores the SMA values

//
for i in range(window_size, len(closing_price)):
        sma_values[i] = np.mean(closing_price[i - window_size:i])
//

This loop calculates the mean i.e Moving Average. 

Finally, data is plotted in chart using matplotlib library.
